**Animations & Interactions:**
- Add hover effects on dice (maybe a subtle lift with `transform: translateY(-2px)`)
- Smooth transitions when dice get held/released
- Button press animations (`:active` states)
- Maybe a pulse animation on the roll button
- Smooth confetti entrance/exit

**Visual Polish:**
- Gradient backgrounds instead of solid colors
- Better shadows (maybe layered box-shadows)
- Subtle border on the main container
- Maybe some CSS variables for your color palette
- Dice could have a subtle gradient or texture

**Responsive Design:**
- Media queries for mobile (smaller dice, different grid layout)
- Make sure it looks good on different screen sizes

**Fun Details:**
- Custom focus states for accessibility
- Maybe dice "wobble" slightly when they're not held
- Color-coded dice based on their values?
- Smooth color transitions when dice get held

**Modern CSS Features:**
- CSS custom properties for theming
- `backdrop-filter` effects
- Maybe some subtle `clip-path` shapes
